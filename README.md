# Exploring Art Market Dynamics
This repository contains code and analysis for my research project focused on understanding the determinants of final art prices. Through data analysis and modeling, I investigate various factors that influence the prices of artworks, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of the art market.

## DATASET N.1: CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE
This dataset, sourced from [Christie's auction house](https://github.com/georgiecoetzer/What-Makes-Art-Valuable/tree/main), encompasses records from 2012 to 2022, detailing approximately 1,187 artworks. Data was gathered using Selenium for web scraping. The dataset emphasizes artist characteristics and artwork details.

Key Variables:

Artist: Artist's name and lifespan.
Art Title & DoC: Title and creation date of the artwork.
Price & Estimates: Sold price, with low and high estimates.
Auction Details: Auction title, closing date, and accuracy of price estimates.
Artwork Details: Dimensions and currency (typically USD).
Artist Metrics: Age, alive status, and popularity.
